This a github repository which stores my progress on my acm project on discord bots.
I've just made a sample discord bot.
We are currently doing courses on Working with OpenAI. We'll finish one of the course by tomorrow and we'll continue it later.
This week we are planning to learn about replit and different functionalities of a discord bot.
